# Academic Academic Academic Paper Generator 1.0

## Description
This is an Academic Paper Generator. A project inspired by [Chicken Chicken Chicken](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf) and [Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf).

Created by Yufeng Zhao and Jingtian Zong.

Special thanks to Richard Huang.

## How it works
Take your input, write the paper for you in TeX code, and convert it into PDF via a compiling server deployed on heroku.
