# Academic Academic Academic Paper Generator 1.0

## Description
This is an Academic Paper Generator. A project inspired by [Chicken Chicken Chicken](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/files/chicken.pdf) and [Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf).

Made by Yufeng Zhao and Jingtian Zong.

Special thanks to Richard Huang.

## How it works
Take your input, write the paper for you in TeX code, and convert it into PDF via Cloudconvert.
